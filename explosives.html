          <h2> Ingredients:<h2>
              <p>4 parts pulverized fire ant corpses: Absorbs ambient magical energy. </br>
                2 parts Void Salt: Highly unstable when catalyzed. </br>
                1 part Silver: Acts as a magical conductor. </br>
                A vial of equine Blood: For binding and ignition. </br></p>
              <strong>&lt;Crawler Drakea, 22ndEdition&gt;</strong>
              <h2> Preparation:</h2>
              <p>1. Grind the Void Salt to a fine dust. This is crucial; coarse grains lead to unstable burn rates. </br>
                2. Mix with Fire Ant Corpses carefully in a stone mortar. Any static might trigger an early reaction, given the Ant's volatile nature. </br>
                3. Fold in the Silver Ash. This step requires precision—too much and the explosive burns cold, too little and it won’t channel the arcane energy needed for a full detonation. </br>
                4. Add horse Blood drop by drop while continuously stirring. The blood acts not only as a binder but also as an arcane catalyst, igniting the magical properties of the other ingredients. </br></p>
              <h2>Usage:</h2>
              <p> The resulting blast not only tears through physical matter but also disrupts magical barriers and enchantments, thanks to the Void Salt. </br>
                This explosive has proven invaluable in breaching the sealed catacombs and ancient vaults that are too often guarded by more than just physical locks. Be warned, though—the potency of this mixture means that any error in preparation could be disastrous. Each component must be balanced perfectly to avoid unintended detonations. </br>
                Reflecting on the uses and dangers of such power, I am reminded of the burden of knowledge. Each explosion carves a path forward, yet also deepens the shadows that lurk just beyond the dungeon's torchlight.</br></p>

          <div class="content" style="display: none;">
            <h2> Ingredients:<h2>
                <p>Leather satchel with reinforced seams </br>
                  3 sticks of Hobgoblin Dynamite</br>
                  16 oz bugbear paste </br>
                  0.05 oz soul crystal shard</br>
                  Detonator and wiring kit</br>
                  Safety fuse</br></p>
                <strong>&lt;Crawler Drakea, 22ndEdition&gt;</strong>
                <h2> Preparation:</h2>
                <p>1. Prepare the Satchel: Ensure the leather satchel is sturdy and the seams are reinforced to withstand the blast.</br>
                  2. Insert Dynamite: Place three sticks of Hobgoblin Dynamite evenly spaced within the satchel.</br>
                  3. Shard: Place the shard in the middle. It will be ridiculously tiny but it must be EXACT center. Seal it in place with the bugbear paste.</br>
                  4. Wiring: Connect each stick of dynamite to a central detonator using the wiring kit. Ensure all connections are secure. </br>
                  5.Fuse Installation: Attach a safety fuse to the detonator, allowing enough length to reach a safe distance before detonation.</br></p>
                <h2>WARNING:</h2>
                <p> BE CAREFUL. THese things will level a town block and they will degrade A LOT faster than you think. </br></p>

                    <p>"Comrades, you know the high-level madness satchels, the bronze tier ones with the big yield? They are not as useless as they look. Because they randomly fall into rapid de-stability and explode, they are most dangerous unless they are in your inventory, of course. But with the 15-second waiting period after removing it, it makes them almost impossible to use because they can (and do) explode during those fifteen seconds. I have discovered a solution. If you can find or build an equippable backpack, they will not lose stability as long as they are in the backpack and the backpack is equipped. This also works for other party members if you wish to give them explosives to utilize. Use with caution."<br>

                    <p>"There is no longer a 15-second waiting period for removing items from inventory, so this advice is mostly moot. I can confirm that backpacks do still maintain stability. They weigh you down, however, and don’t work as well as inventory."<br>

                  <div class="content" style="display: none;">
                    <h2> Ingredients:<h2>
                        <p>Potassium nitrate </br>
                          3 sticks of Hobgoblin Dynamite</br>
                          Sugar </br>
                          Organic dye for smoke color</br>
                          Cardboard tubes</br></p>
                        <strong>&lt;Crawler Drakea, 22ndEdition&gt;</strong>
                        <h2> Instructions::</h2>
                        <p>Prepare Mixture: Mix potassium nitrate and sugar in a 3:2 ratio.</br>
                          Add Dye: Integrate organic dye to achieve the desired smoke color.</br>
                          Fill Tubes: Pack the mixture into cardboard tubes, leaving room at the top for ignition.</br>
                          Ignition Setup: Install a simple ignition wick at the top of each tube.</br>
                          Packaging: Package the tubes in sets of twelve, ensuring they are well-protected and labeled.</br></p>
                        <h2>Deployment:</h2>
                        <p> Positioning: Choose the location for deployment carefully. The smoke will spread primarily downwind, so position yourself upwind of the target area to prevent self-exposure.</br>
                          Ignition: Light the wick using a lighter or a spark-producing mechanism. The wick will hiss and pop like a sparkler, indicating that the bomb is active. It is designed to burn rapidly to produce smoke quickly.</br>
                          Immediate Retreat: Once lit, immediately place the smoke bomb on the ground or throw it to the desired location, ensuring it is away from flammable materials. Quickly move to a safe distance to avoid the dense smoke. </br></p>
                        <h2>Tactical Considerations:</h2>
                        <p>Cover and Movement: Use the smoke as cover for movement across exposed areas or for tactical retreats. The dense smoke provides excellent visual obstruction for repositioning or escaping.</br>
                          Distraction: Deploy smoke bombs to create a diversion or to distract enemies during an engagement. The sudden appearance of smoke can be used to mislead opponents about your actual position or numbers.</br>
                          Enclosed Spaces: In enclosed spaces, use with caution. The smoke will fill the area quickly and can cause disorientation and reduced visibility for everyone, including allies unless they are immune.</p>
